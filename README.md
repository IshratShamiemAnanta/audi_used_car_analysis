--- Task 1 ---

-> Reading a csv file (audi.csv) and displaying the whole dataset.                                
-> Finding out the percentage of cars with respect to model, year, transmission and fuelType.                                     
-> Displaying the percentage of cars with respect to model, year, transmission and fuelType in the form of a barplot.

--- Task 2 ---

-> Displaying the price of cars with respect to mileage, year, mpg and engineSize in addition to transmission in the form of a scatterplot.     
-> Depicting the price of cars with respect to mileage, year, mpg and engineSize with a trend line in the form of a regressionplot.

--- Task 3 ---

-> Displaying the price of cars with respect to mileage, year, mpg and engineSize in the form of a histogram.                         
-> Portaying the Distribution and ECDF plots for mileage and mpg of the cars.
    
--- Task 4 ---

-> Displaying the  mileage and mpg of cars with respect to transmission in the form of a boxplot.

--- Task 5 ---

-> EDA using groupby and showing the barplots of the cars based on model, transmission and fuel type.                                                                      
-> Finding out the top 5 selling car models in the dataset along with the average selling price and the total sale value of the same.

--- Task 6 ---

-> Separating the numeric features and target variable.                                                           
-> Splitting the original dataset into the train set (80%) and the test set (20%).                                                                    
-> Performing Linear Regression and Predict the 'Price' from the test set.                                                                                     
-> Finding the RMSE value from the actual test data and the predicted data.
